SELECT with JOIN practice:

Join the OrderDetails and Products tables, to show a report where the columns are OrderID, ProductName, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.

Select o.OrderID,p.ProductName,o.Quantity from OrderDetails As o inner join Products As p on o.ProductID = p.ProductID; 


Join the Orders, OrderDetails, and Employees tables to return a report with with the EmployeeName, ProductID, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.  Hint: EmployeeName is not a column in the Employee table, but you can generate a
report with EmployeeName by starting your SQL this way: SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName,

SELECT (E.FirstName || " " || E.LastName) AS EmployeeName,OD.ProductID,OD.Quantity from Orders inner join Employees As E on Orders.EmployeeID = E.EmployeeID inner join OrderDetails As OD on Orders.OrderID = OD.OrderID
